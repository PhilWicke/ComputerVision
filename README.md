This repository contains a selection of standard Computer Vision algorithms such as object recognition, filtering and basic image processing. 
The Image Processing Toolbox is only required for parts that make use of a webcam. But there is also a workaround given, which takes the video stream of a local IP input such as [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) provides using your mobile phone camera.

## Basic Processing
+ Image extraction
+ Rotation, flipping, mirroring
+ Noise (gaussian, salt & pepper, etc)
+ Point operators, histogram, binarization

## Local Operators
+ Convolution
+ Edge Detection
+ Nonlinear smoothing
+ Morphological operators

## Colors
+ Object Tracking
+ Object Recognition

## Segmentation
+ Region labeling
+ Relaxation labeling

## Color Segmentation
+ Color distribution
+ k-means clustering

## Hough Transform
+ Hough Transform
+ Circular Hough Transfrom
+ Iris detection

## Fourier Transform
+ Example, implementation and application
